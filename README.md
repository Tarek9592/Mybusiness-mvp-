# mybusiness â€“ MVP (Next.js)

Ready-to-deploy MVP for a Business Plan Generator (Arabic/English).

## Quick start (Local)
1) Install Node.js LTS (18+).
2) In the project directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3) Open http://localhost:3000

## Deploy to Vercel
1) Push this folder to a new GitHub repo (e.g., `mybusiness-mvp`).
2) Go to https://vercel.com/import and select the repo.
3) Keep defaults. Build runs automatically. Done.

## Notes
- App dir routing (Next.js 14)
- API sample at `/api/health` returns JSON
- Replace the plan generator with your AI integration later.
